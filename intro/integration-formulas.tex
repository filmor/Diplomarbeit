\subsection{Integration Lemmas}
During the course of this thesis we will see some recurring patterns in the
integrals that have to be solved. We will thus list some explicit formulas for
them now and prove the simpler ones here.

The first one is a classical result of asymptotic analysis and is the basis of
most further results on the asymptotics of exponential integrals.
\begin{Lemma}[Watson's Lemma]
  \input{snippets/watsons-lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Since the proof is a bit lengthy and not needed to understand the following
    it can be found in \cref{sec:proof-watson}.
  \end{proof}
\end{Lemma}
The next lemma considers the continuity properties of exponential integrals like
the ones Watson's lemma deals with:
\begin{Lemma}
  \label{lem:continuity_of_watson_integrals}
  Let $f\colon [0,T)\to\mathbb{R}$ (where $T$ may be $\infty$) be an integrable
  function. Then the exponential parameter integral
  \begin{equation*}
    F(x) = \Integ[T]{0}{t}{\Eto{-tx} f(t)}
  \end{equation*}
  is continuous in $x$.
  \begin{Proof}
    The statement follows immediately from a classical result of Lebesgue
    integration theory on the continuity of parameter-dependent integrals
    (cf.\ \cite[p282f]{Konigsberger2004}). We only need to check, that there is
    an integrable majorant for all $x$, which is simply $f(t)$ in this case, and
    that the whole integrand is continuous in $x$ for fixed $t$ which is
    obvious.
  \end{Proof}
\end{Lemma}
The third lemma is a quite general formula for nested integrals, in which the
upper limit of the inner integral is the integration variable of the outer one:
\input{snippets/integration-lemma}
\begin{Remark}
  This is in fact only Fubini's theorem for the integral of $(x,y)\to g(x)f(y)$
  over a right-angled triangle.
\end{Remark}
Finally we give a formula for a particular kind of integral that comes up a lot
in the calculations:
\begin{Lemma}
  \label{lem:beta_function_formula}
  Let $a, b > 0$ and $m > n$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \Integ[\infty]{0}{x}{\frac{x^n}{(a^2 + b^2 x^2)^{m}}} =
    \frac{a^{n-2m+1}}{2b^{n+1}}B\bigl(\tfrac{n+1}{2}, \tfrac{2m - n -
    1}{2}\bigr),
  \end{align*}
  where $B$ denotes the beta function.
  \begin{Proof}
    \begin{align*}
      \Integ[\infty]{0}{x}{\frac{x^n}{(a^2 + b^2 x^2)^{m}}} 
      &= \frac{a^{n-2m+1}}{b^{n+1}} \Integ[\infty]{0}{y}{\frac{y^n}{(1 +
  y^2)^m}}
        &\text{with $y = bx / a$} \\
        &= \frac{a^{n - 2m + 1}}{2b^{n+1}}
        \Integ[\infty]{0}{z}{\frac{z^{\frac{n-1}{2}}}{(1 + z)^n}}
        &\text{with $z = \sqrt{y}$}\\
        &= \frac{a^{n-2m+1}}{2b^{n+1}}B\bigl(\tfrac{n+1}{2}, \tfrac{2m - n -
      1}{2}\bigr)
    \end{align*}
    The formula used in the last step,
    \begin{equation*}
      B(a,b) = \Integ[\infty]{0}{z}{\frac{z^{a-1}}{(1+z)^{a+b}}},
    \end{equation*}
    is proven in the \cref{sec:beta_function}.
  \end{Proof}
\end{Lemma}
