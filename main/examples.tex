\section{Examples}
Finally we want to actually make use of our fine formula and evaluate it for
some selected testing functions. To do that we first calculate $V$ and $W$ from
the given $f$ and then evaluate the $x$-integral left in the formula of the
error term.

\subsection{Linear function}
The first canonical example we can use is a linear function
\begin{align}
  f(x) &:= mx + b \\
  V(x) &= (mx + b)^{-2} \\
  W(x) &= -\frac m 2 V(x)
\end{align}
