\section{Asymptotics of the Interior Parametrix}
In this section we aim to prove the following Theorem:
\begin{MainTheorem}
  \label{main:interior}
  \input{snippets/main-interior}
  \begin{Remark}
    For $V\equiv 0$ this expansion has already been proven in
    \cite[Ch 2.1]{Gel'fand1975} (where $z^2 \mapsto \zeta$ and $W(x) \mapsto
    u(x)$) and calculated for even higher orders, but we will restrict ourselves
    in this text to what we need for the particular calculation we want to do in
    the end.  The Appendix~\ref{app:source-code} contains the source code for a
    simple Python program that calculates the asymptotic components (apart from
    the $x$-Integration) of the resolvent trace, as well as a list of the
    coefficients to higher order.
  \end{Remark}
\end{MainTheorem}
To do this we first note that the asymptotic expansion exists by a classical
theorem on the theory of pseudo-differential operators with paramater, namely
\begin{Theorem}
  Let $M$ be a closed $n$-dimensional smooth manifold and
  $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^p$ a cone and $A\in\mathrm{CL}^m(M;\Gamma)$ (the set
  of classical pseudo-differential operators with parameter).

  If $m+n<0$ then for all $x\in M$, then for $\mu\in\Gamma$ $A(\mu)$ is
  trace-class and $\Tr A(\cdot)\in \mathrm{CS}^{m+n}(\Gamma)$ (the space of
  classical symbols), with
  \begin{align*}
    \Tr A(\mu)\SimAs{\Abs{\mu}\to\infty}
    \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} e_{m-j}\bigl(\tfrac{\mu}{\Abs{\mu}}\bigr)
    \Abs{\mu}^{m+n-j}.
  \end{align*}
  \begin{Proof}
    A proof can be found in \cite[Thm 5.1]{Les:PDO}, where it is shown in the
    slightly more general case of log-polynomial asymptotics. The idea is first
    prove a corresponding asymptotic expansion of the kernel on the diagonal by
    use of the asymptotic expansion of the symbol, which is given for classical
    operators. The theorem follows then by integrating the expansion of the
    kernel over $x$, which is well-defined as $M$ is compact.
  \end{Proof}
\end{Theorem}
Using that as well as the product formula for pseudo-differential operators, we
prove the explicit formula in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.

\subsection{Calculation of the first coefficients}
The multi-parametric symbol of the operator $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ is
\begin{align}
  a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \xi^2 + \lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 \\
  a_0(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= W(x),
  \label{eqn:symbol}
\end{align}
with all other $a_n \equiv 0$. To not complicate the following calculations we
suppress the continuous repetition of the parameters, a prime ($a_2'$) denotes
the derivative in $x$.

We use the following product formula for symbols: Let $A$ and $B$ be
pseudo-differential operators with symbols $a$ and $b$, respectively. Then the
complete symbol of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)B$ is (modulo $S^\infty$) given by
\begin{align}
  a * b := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\ \partial_\xi^n a\,D_x^n b,
  \label{eqn:product-formula}
\end{align}
where $D_x^n := (-i)^n \partial_x^n$. A proof of this formula can be found in
\cite[Thm 3.4]{Shu:POS}.

We are interested in the symbol of the parametrix, so we demand
\begin{align*}
  a * b \sim 1,
\end{align*}
so the asymptotic expansion of $a * b$ in the symbol spaces is supposed to be
$(a * b)_n \equiv \delta_{n0}$ if $B$ is a parametrix of $A$. Actually this will
also work for $b * a$, i.e.\ $BA$, but this complicates further calculations as
with the chosen order we only have $\xi$-derivatives of $a = a_2 + a_0$ which
are
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\xi} a = 2\xi \text{ and } \partial_{\xi}^2 a = 2.
\end{align}
Thus the sum in \eqref{eqn:product-formula} collapses and only three terms are
left:
\begin{align*}
  a * b &= (a_2 + a_0)b - 2\xi\mathrm i\,\partial_x b - \partial_x^2 b
  \ \mathrel{\overset{!}{\sim}}\ 1, \\
  \newtag
  \label{eqn:int-recursion}
  \Rightarrow b_{-n} &= \frac1{a_2} \left( 2\xi\mathrm i\, \partial_x b_{-(n-1)}
  + \partial_x^2 b_{-(n-2)} - a_0 b_{-(n-2)} \right),
\end{align*}
with the starting values $b_0 = 0$, $b_{-1} = 0$ and $b_{-2} = a_2^{-1}$ since
the order of the inverse has to be $-2$. We can now inductively derive the first
coefficients of the parametrix of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$:
\begin{align*}
  \label{eqn:coeff-symbol}
  b_{-2} &= \frac{1}{a_2} \\
  b_{-3} &= -2\frac{\xi a_2'}{a_2^3}\\
  b_{-4} &= 4\xi^2\left(\frac{a_2''}{a_2^4}
  - 3\frac{(a_2')^2}{a_2^5}\right) - \frac{a_0}{a_2^2}
  - 2\frac{a_2''}{a_2^3} + 2\frac{(a_2')^2}{a_2^4}
\end{align*}
Since we are ultimately interested in the kernel on the diagonal we will need to
integrate the resulting symbol for the parametrix, since for a
pseudo-differential operator $A$ with symbol $a$ we have
\begin{align*}
  k_A(x,y) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Oscint{\xi}{
    \Eto{\mathrm i\left\langle x-y, \xi\right\rangle} a(x,\xi)
  }
  \quad
  \Rightarrow
  \quad
  k(x,x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{\xi}{a(x,\xi)},
\end{align*}
where $\Oscint{\xi}{\,\cdot\,}$ denotes the oscillatory integral (as defined in
\cite[Def.~1.1]{Shu:POS}), which coincides with the usual integral over
$\mathbb{R}$ for $x = y$. The integrals over $\xi$ can be handled with in a
uniform way using the beta function as seen in the introduction
(\ref{lem:beta_function_formula}) by setting $n = (\text{order of $\xi$ in the
numerator})$, $m = \text{exponent of $a_2$ in the denominator}$,
$a=\mu(x)=\sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + W(x)}$ and $b = 1$. We also see, that for odd
$n$ the terms vanish, as we have an integral over an odd function, while for
even $n$ we get an additional factor of $2$ for integrating over $\mathbb{R}$
instead of $\Rplus$.

The corresponding terms in the kernel are thus
\begin{align*}
  k_{-1}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2)^{1/2}} \\
  k_{-2}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= 0 \\
  k_{-3}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= - \frac{1}{16} \frac{\lambda^2 V''(x)}{(\lambda^2
    V(x) + z^2)^{5/2}} + \frac{5}{64} \frac{\lambda^4 V'(x)^2}{(\lambda^2V(x)
    + z^2)^{7/2}} -\frac{1}{4}\frac{W(x)}{(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2)^{3/2}}.
  \label{eqn:coeff-kernel}
\end{align*}
We note, that the $(\lambda,z)$-order of the integrated terms increases by $1$
which is reflected by a change of the index.

These are the first three asymptotic components of the kernel of
$(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$ on the open interval $(0,1)$, i.e.\ if we define
$\mu(x) := \sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2}$ as above we have
\begin{align*}
  \input{snippets/formula-interior},
\end{align*}
which proves \thref{main:interior}. The asymptotic order of the remainder of
$-4$ follows from the fact, that by construction every other step in our
recursion formula results in the exponents of $\xi$ in the numerator being odd,
so the $\xi$ integral over $\mathbb{R}$ vanishes, in particular $k_{-4} =
0$.

Finally for this to give us all the information we were looking for we need to
carry out the $x$-Integration. Since by Equation~\eqref{frm:shift} and
Equation~\eqref{eqn:central-thm} we know, that we will only differentiate the
formula and integrate the result multiplied with a $\log\lambda$-term, and all
intermediate steps are integrable we can postpone the evaluation until we have
enough information on $V$ and $W$ to perform the integration.

\subsection{Homogeneity in $V$, $W$ and their Derivatives}
We see by closely looking on the generating Equation~\eqref{eqn:int-recursion}
that we can (without carrying out the explicit calculations) show that the terms
in the kernel expansion have a certain structure.

First, we define an order for the building blocks in the numerator of the
terms in the expansion:
\begin{Definition}
  We define an order on terms of $V$ and $W$ by:
  \begin{align*}
    &\ord \lambda^2 V(x) := 0 \\
    &\ord W(x) := 2
  \end{align*}
  For $A(x)\neq 0$ and $B(x)$ being rational expressions in $V$, $W$ and their
  derivatives, and $C\in\mathbb{C}$ we also define the following calculation
  rules:
  \begin{align*}
    \ord C &:= 0 \\
    \ord A(x)^{C} &:= C\ord A(x) \\
    \ord \partial_x A(x) &:= \ord(A(x)) + 1 \\
    \ord A(x)B(x) &:= \ord A(x) + \ord B(x)
  \end{align*}
  The sum of two terms $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ has a well-defined order if $\ord A(x)
  = \ord B(x)$, namely $\ord(A(x) + B(x)) = \ord A(x) = \ord B(x)$.
\end{Definition}
% TODO: Wohldefininiertheit zeigen

We know by construction that, apart from some complex constant, only derivatives
of $\lambda^2 V(x)$ (in form of derivatives of $a_2$), $W(x)$ as well as
derivatives of $W(x)$ may appear in the numerator. The denominator is uniquely
defined by the count of $\lambda^2 V^{(l)}(x)$ terms in the numerator, i.e.\ if
there are $k$ factors of $\lambda^2 V^{(l)}$, then the denominator is
$(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2)^{(n+2k-1)/2}$, by $(\lambda,z)$-homogeneity.

For the numerator we can see, that the order of the expression always adds up to
$n-2$ ($n$ being the $(\lambda,z)$-order, for example if we consider $n=4$ we
have the following possibilities
\begin{align*}
  V''(x), W(x), (V'(x))^2,
\end{align*}
since those are exactly the terms with order $2$ we can produce. This is what we
will proof now:
\begin{Theorem}
  Given the previous definition of the order $\ord$ in $V$, $W$ and their
  respective derivatives the following holds for the terms in the asymptotic
  expansion of the kernel on the diagonal of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$:
  \begin{align}
    \ord k_{-n}(x, x) = n - 1
  \end{align}
  \begin{Proof}
    First we note that the $\xi$-integration does not change the order of the
    expression since
    \begin{align*}
      \ord \frac{\xi^n}{(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 + \xi^2)^m} = \ord (\lambda^2 V(x)
      + z^2)^{n-2m+1} = 0,
    \end{align*}
    thus the order of the term before and after the integration is the same.
    However, since the $(\lambda,z)$-order changes, the indexation is different,
    i.e.\ $k_{-n}$ corresponds to $b_{-(n+1)}$. We
    thus prove the claim
    \begin{align*}
      \ord k_{-(n-1)} = \ord b_{-n} = n - 2
    \end{align*}
    by induction over $n$ on symbol level. We start with $b_{-2} = a_2^{-1} =
    (\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 + \xi^2)^{-1}$, which clearly has order $0$. Since the
    recursion formula involves the two previous terms we also need to check
    $b_{-3}$:
    \begin{align*}
      \ord b_{-3} = \ord 2\xi \frac{a_2'}{a_2^3} = \ord a_2' = \ord \lambda^2
      V'(x) = 1
    \end{align*}
    For the induction step we only need to look closely on the recursion formula
    \eqref{eqn:int-recursion} and use the given calculation rules:
    \begin{align*}
      &\ord 2\xi i \partial_x b_{-(n-1)} = \ord \partial_x b_{-(n-1)} = ((n-1) - 2) +
      1 = n - 2\\
      &\ord \partial_x^2 b_{-(n-2)} = ((n - 2) - 2) + 2 = n - 2 \\
      &\ord a_0 b_{-(n-2)} = \ord W(x) b_{-(n-2)} = 2 + ((n-2) - 2) = n - 2
    \end{align*}
    Since $b_{-n}$ is the sum of those terms divided by $a_2$, which has order
    $0$ this proves the homogeneity in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.
  \end{Proof}
\end{Theorem}
