\section{Asymptotics of the Interior Parametrix}
In this section we aim to prove the following Theorem:
\begin{MainTheorem}
  Let $\Delta_\lambda := -\partial_x^2 + \lambda^2V(x)+W(x)$ be an operator as
  introduced beforehand and $\mu(x) := \sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2}$ (thus
  $\mu(x)$ has the same order as $\lambda$ and $z$, since $V(x) > 0$ is given).
  Then the trace of the resolvent of $\Delta_\lambda$ has the following common
  asymptotic expansion in its parameter $\lambda$ and the resolvent parameter
  $z$:
  \begin{align*}
    \input{snippets/formula-interior}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{Remark}
    For $V\equiv 0$ this expansion has already been proven in \cite{gelfand}
    (where $z^2 \mapsto \zeta$ and $W(x) \mapsto u(x)$) and calculated for even
    higher orders, but we will restrict ourselves in this text to what we need
    for the particular calculation we want to do in the end.  The
    Appendix~\ref{app:source-code} contains the source code for a simple Python
    program that calculates the asymptotic components (apart from the
    $x$-Integration) of the resolvent trace, as well as a list of the
    coefficients to higher order.
  \end{Remark}
\end{MainTheorem}
To do this we first note that the asymptotic expansion exists by a classical
theorem on the theory of pseudo-differential operators with paramater, namely
\begin{Theorem}
  Let $M$ be a closed $n$-dimensional smooth manifold, $E$ and $F$ smooth
  vector bundles over $M$, and $A\in\mathrm{CL}^m(M,E; F)$ (the set of
  classical pseudo-differential operators).

  If $m+n<0$ then for all $x\in M$ $A(x)$ is trace-class and $\Tr A(\cdot)\in
  \mathrm{CS}^{m+n}(\Gamma)$, with
  \begin{align*}
    \Tr A(x)\SimAs{\left|x\right|\to\infty}
    \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} e_{m-j}\bigl(\tfrac{x}{\left|x\right|}\bigr)
    \left|x\right|^{m+n-j}
  \end{align*}
  \begin{Proof}
    A proof can be found in \cite{Lesch10}.
  \end{Proof}
\end{Theorem}
Using that as well as the product formula for pseudo-differential operators, we
prove the explicit formula in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.

\subsection{Calculation of the first coefficients}
The multi-parametric symbol of the operator $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ is
\begin{align}
  a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \xi^2 + \lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 \\
  a_0(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= W(x),
  \label{eqn:symbol}
\end{align}
with all other $a_n \equiv 0$. To not complicate the following calculations we
suppress the continuous repetition of the parameters, a prime ($a_2'$) denotes
the derivative in $x$.

We use the following product formula for symbols: Let $A$ and $B$ be
pseudo-differential operators with symbols $a$ and $b$, respectively. Then the
complete symbol of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)B$ is (modulo $S^\infty$) given by
\begin{align}
  a * b := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\ \partial_\xi^n a\,D_x^n b.
  \label{eqn:product-formula}
\end{align}
A proof of this formula can be found in \cite[Thm 3.4]{Shu:POS}.

We are interested in the symbol of the parametrix, so we demand
\begin{align*}
  a * b \sim 1,
\end{align*}
so the asymptotic expansion of $a * b$ in the symbol spaces is supposed to be
$(a * b)_n \equiv \delta_{n0}$ if $B$ is a parametrix of $A$. Actually this will
also work for $b * a$, i.~e.\ $BA$, but this complicates further calculations as
with the chosen order we only have $\xi$-derivatives of $a_n$ which are
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\xi} a = 2\xi \text{ and } \partial_{\xi}^2 a = 2.
\end{align}
Thus the above sum collapses and only three terms are left:
\begin{align}
  a * b = (a_2 + a_0)b - 2\xi\mathrm i\,\partial_x b - \partial_x^2 b
\end{align}

From the known asymptotics of $a$ we can now inductively derive the first
coefficients of the parametrix of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$:
\begin{align*}
  b_{-2} &= \frac{1}{a_2} \\
  b_{-3} &= -2\frac{\xi a_2'}{a_2^3}\\
  b_{-4} &= 4\frac{\xi^2 a_2''}{a_2^4}
  - 12\frac{\xi^2 (a_2')^2}{a_2^5} - \frac{a_0}{a_2^2}
  - 2\frac{a_2''}{a_2^3} + 2\frac{(a_2')^2}{a_2^4} \\
  \label{eqn:coeff-symbol}
\end{align*}

Since we are ultimately interested in the kernel on the diagonal we will need to
integrate the resulting symbol for the parametrix, since for a
pseudo-differential operator $A$ with symbol $a$ we have
\begin{align*}
  k_A(x,y) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Oscint{\xi}{
    \Eto{\mathrm i\left\langle x-y, \xi\right\rangle} a(x,\xi)
  }
  \quad
  \Rightarrow
  \quad
  k(x,x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{\xi}{a(x,\xi)},
\end{align*}
where $\Oscint{\xi}\cdot$ denotes the oscillating integral (as defined in
\cite[]{Shu:POS}), which coincides with the usual integral over $\mathbb{R}$ for
$x = y$. The integrals over $\xi$ can be handled with in a uniform way using the
beta function as seen in the introduction (\ref{lem:beta_function_formula}) by
setting $n = \text{order of $\xi$ in the numerator}$, $m = \tfrac12\text{order
of $a_2$ in the denominator}$, $a=\mu(x)=\sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + W(x)}$ and $b =
1$. We also see, that for odd $n$ the terms vanish, as we have an integral over
an odd function, while for even $n$ we get an additional factor of $2$ for
integrating over $\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\Rplus$.

The corresponding terms in the kernel are thus
\begin{align}
  k_{b_{-1}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2} \\
  k_{b_{-2}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= 0 \\
  k_{b_{-3}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= - \frac{1}{16} \frac{\lambda^2 V''(x)}{(\lambda^2
    V(x) + z^2)^{5/2}} + \frac{5}{64} \frac{\lambda^4 V'(x)^2}{(\lambda^2V(x)
    + z^2)^{7/2}} -\frac{1}{4}\frac{W(x)}{(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2)^{3/2}}.
  \label{eqn:coeff-kernel}
\end{align}

These are the first three asymptotic components of the kernel of
$(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$ on the open interval $(0,1)$, i.e.\ if we define
$\mu(x) := \sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2}$ as above we have
\begin{align*}
  \input{snippets/formula-interior}.
\end{align*}
% TODO: Oben allgemein angeben, folgt ja aus der Rekursionsformel
% Was heiÃŸt das?!
The asymptotic order of the remainder of $-5$ follows from the fact, that by
construction every other step in our recursion formula results in the exponents
of $\xi$ in the numerator being odd, so the $\xi$ integral over $\mathbb{R}$
vanishes, in particular $k_{b_{-4}} = 0$.

Finally for this to give us all the information we were looking for we need to
carry out the $x$-Integration. Evaluating this integral will be postponed until
we have done the necessary formal steps to get to $\Tr(\Delta_\lambda +
z^2)^{-2}$, and evaluate the $(\lambda,z)$-integral. Since by
Equation~\eqref{frm:shift} and Equation~\eqref{eqn:central-theorem} we know,
that we will only differentiate and integrate with a $\ln\lambda$-term, and all
intermediate steps are integrable we can indeed postpone the evaluation until we
have enough information on $V$ and $W$ to perform the integration.
