\section{Asymptotics for the interior parametrix}
In this section we aim to prove the following Theorem:
\input{snippets/main-interior}
To do this we first show that the asymptotic expansion exists and, using that as
well as the product formula for pseudo-differential operators, prove the
explicit formula in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.
\subsection{Existence}
By the following classical theorem an elliptic pseudo-differential operator with
parameter has an asymptotic expansion in its parameter:
\input{snippets/trace-expansion}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Calculation of the first coefficients}
% Kein Neumann! Einfach integrieren!
The multi-parametric symbol of the operator $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ is
\begin{align}
    a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \xi^2 + \lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 \\
    a_0(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= W(x),
    \label{eqn:symbol}
\end{align}
with all other $a_n \equiv 0$.

We use the following product formula for symbols:
\begin{align}
    =
    \label{eqn:product-formula}
\end{align}
This variant is chosen deliberately, since we thus have to calculate fewer
$x$-derivatives.

Since we are ultimately interested in the kernel on the diagonal we will need to
integrate the resulting symbol for the parametrix, since
\begin{align*}
    k(x,y) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathrm{O}}{\xi}{
        \Eto{\mathrm i\left\langle x-y, \xi\right\rangle} a(x,\xi)
        } \\
    \Rightarrow k(x,x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{\xi}{a(x,\xi)},
\end{align*}
where $\int_{O}$ denotes the oscillating integral (REF), which coincides with
the usual integral for $x = y$.

Using the product formula we can inductively derive the first coefficients
of the parametrix of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ to be
\begin{align}
    b_{-2}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= (a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z))^{-1} \\
    b_{-3}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \\
    b_{-4}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &=
    \label{eqn:coeff-symbol}
\end{align}
The corresponding terms in the kernel are thus
\begin{align}
    k_{b_{-1}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    k_{b_{-2}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    k_{b_{-3}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    \label{eqn:coeff-kernel}
\end{align}

To now get the coefficients of the kernel of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-2}$ we
formally derive by $z$
