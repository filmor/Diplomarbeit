\section{Asymptotics for the interior parametrix}
In this section we aim to prove the following Theorem:
\input{snippets/main-interior}
To do this we first show that the asymptotic expansion exists and, using that as
well as the product formula for pseudo-differential operators, prove the
explicit formula in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.
\subsection{Existence}
By the following classical theorem an elliptic pseudo-differential operator with
parameter has an asymptotic expansion in its parameter:
\input{snippets/trace-expansion}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Calculation of the first coefficients}
The multi-parametric symbol of the operator $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ is
\begin{align}
  % TODO: Array
    a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \xi^2 + \lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 \\
    a_0(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= W(x),
    \label{eqn:symbol}
\end{align}
with all other $a_n \equiv 0$.

% TODO REF: Shubin Thm 3.4, p 27
We use the following product formula for symbols. Let $B$ be a
pseudo-differential operator with symbol $a$ and $b$. Then the complete symbol
of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)B$ is (modulo $S^\infty$)
\begin{align}
  a * b := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\ \partial_\xi^n a\,D_x^n b
  \label{eqn:product-formula}
\end{align}
We are interested in the symbol of the parametrix, so we demand
\begin{align*}
  a * b \sim 1,
\end{align*}
so the asymptotic expansion of $(a*b)$ in the symbol spaces is supposed to be
$(a * b)_n \equiv \delta_{n0}$. Actually this will also work for $(b * a)$,
i.~e.\ $BA$, but this complicates further calculations as with the chosen order
we only have $\xi$-derivatives of $a_n$ which are
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\xi} a = 2\xi \text{ and } \partial_{\xi}^2 a = 2.
\end{align}
Thus the above sum collapses and only three terms are left:
\begin{align}
  a * b = (a_2 + a_0)b - 2\xi\mathrm i\,\partial_x b - \partial_x^2 b.
\end{align}
We will now split up $b$ in its asymptotic components.

From the known asymptotics of $a$ we can now inductively derive the first
coefficients of the parametrix of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$.
\begin{align}
    b_{-2}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= (a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z))^{-1} \\
    b_{-3}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \\
    b_{-4}(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &=
    \label{eqn:coeff-symbol}
\end{align}

% This variant is chosen deliberately, since we thus have to calculate fewer
% $x$-derivatives.

Since we are ultimately interested in the kernel on the diagonal we will need to
integrate the resulting symbol for the parametrix, since
\begin{align*}
    k(x,y) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathrm{O}}{\xi}{
        \Eto{\mathrm i\left\langle x-y, \xi\right\rangle} a(x,\xi)
        } \\
    \Rightarrow k(x,x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{\xi}{a(x,\xi)},
\end{align*}
where $\int_{O}$ denotes the oscillating integral (REF), which coincides with
the usual integral over $\mathbb{R}$ for $x = y$.

The corresponding terms in the kernel are thus
\begin{align}
    k_{b_{-1}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    k_{b_{-2}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    k_{b_{-3}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \\
    \label{eqn:coeff-kernel}
\end{align}

To now get the coefficients of the kernel of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-2}$ we
formally derive by $z$
