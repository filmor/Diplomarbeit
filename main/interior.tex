\section{Asymptotics for the interior parametrix}
In this section we aim to prove the following Theorem:
\input{snippets/main-interior}
To do this we first show that the asymptotic expansion exists and, using that as
well as the product formula for pseudo-differential operators, prove the
explicit formula in $V$, $W$ and their derivatives.
\subsection{Existence}
By the following classical theorem an elliptic pseudo-differential operator with
parameter has an asymptotic expansion in its parameter:
\input{snippets/trace-expansion}
\begin{Proof}
\end{Proof}

\subsection{Calculation of the first coefficients}
The multi-parametric symbol of the operator $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$ is
\begin{align}
  % TODO: Array
    a_2(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= \xi^2 + \lambda^2 V(x) + z^2 \\
    a_0(x,\xi,\lambda,z) &= W(x),
    \label{eqn:symbol}
\end{align}
with all other $a_n \equiv 0$.

% TODO REF: Shubin Thm 3.4, p 27
We use the following product formula for symbols. Let $B$ be a
pseudo-differential operator with symbol $a$ and $b$. Then the complete symbol
of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)B$ is (modulo $S^\infty$)
\begin{align}
  a * b := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\ \partial_\xi^n a\,D_x^n b
  \label{eqn:product-formula}
\end{align}
We are interested in the symbol of the parametrix, so we demand
\begin{align*}
  a * b \sim 1,
\end{align*}
so the asymptotic expansion of $(a*b)$ in the symbol spaces is supposed to be
$(a * b)_n \equiv \delta_{n0}$. Actually this will also work for $(b * a)$,
i.~e.\ $BA$, but this complicates further calculations as with the chosen order
we only have $\xi$-derivatives of $a_n$ which are
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\xi} a = 2\xi \text{ and } \partial_{\xi}^2 a = 2.
\end{align}
Thus the above sum collapses and only three terms are left:
\begin{align}
  a * b = (a_2 + a_0)b - 2\xi\mathrm i\,\partial_x b - \partial_x^2 b.
\end{align}
We will now split up $b$ in its asymptotic components.

From the known asymptotics of $a$ we can now inductively derive the first
coefficients of the parametrix of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)$.
\begin{align*}
  b_{-2} &= \frac{1}{a_2} \\
  b_{-3} &= -2\frac{\xi a_2'}{a_2^3}\\
  b_{-4} &= -4\frac{\xi^2 a_2''}{a_2^4}
  + 12\frac{\xi^2 (a_2')^2}{a_2^5} - \frac{a_0}{a_2^2} +
  2\frac{a_2''}{a_2^3} -4\frac{(a_2')^2}{a_2^4}
  \label{eqn:coeff-symbol}
\end{align*}

Since we are ultimately interested in the kernel on the diagonal we will need to
integrate the resulting symbol for the parametrix, since
\begin{align*}
  k(x,y) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\Oscint{\xi}{
    \Eto{\mathrm i\left\langle x-y, \xi\right\rangle} a(x,\xi)
  }
  \quad
  \Rightarrow
  \quad
  k(x,x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{\xi}{a(x,\xi)},
\end{align*}
where $\int_{O}$ denotes the oscillating integral (REF), which coincides with
the usual integral over $\mathbb{R}$ for $x = y$. The integrals can be handled
with in a uniform way using the beta function as seen in the introduction.
% TODO

The corresponding terms in the kernel are thus
\begin{align}
  k_{b_{-1}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2} \\
  k_{b_{-2}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= 0 \\
  k_{b_{-3}}(x,x,\lambda,z) &= \frac{1}{4} \frac{\lambda^2 V''(x)}{(\lambda^2
    V(x) + z^2)^{5/2}} - \frac{25}{64} \frac{\lambda^4 V'(x)^2}{(\lambda^2V(x)
    + z^2)^{7/2}} -\frac{1}{4}\frac{W(x)}{(\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2)^{3/2}}
  \label{eqn:coeff-kernel}
\end{align}

These are the first three asymptotic components of the kernel of
$(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$ on the open interval $(0,1)$, i.e. if we define
$\mu(x) := \sqrt{\lambda^2 V(x) + z^2}$ we have
\begin{align*}
  \Tr(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1} \SimAs{\Abs{(\lambda, z)}\to\infty}&
   \Int{x}{\left(
      \frac12\frac1{\mu(x)^{2}}
     +\frac14\frac{\lambda^2 V''(x)}{\mu(x)^5}
     -\frac{25}{64}\frac{\lambda^4V'(x)^2}{\mu(x)^7}
     -\frac14\frac{W(x)}{\mu(x)^3}
     +O\left(\Abs{(\lambda, z)}^{-5}\right)
   \right)}.
\end{align*}
The asymptotic order of the remainder of $-5$ follows from the fact, that by
construction every other stepin our recursion formula results in the exponents
of $\xi$ in the numerator being odd, so the $\xi$ integral over $\mathbb{R}$
vanishes, in particular $k_{b_{-4}} = 0$.

Finally for this to give us all the information we were looking for we need to
carry out the $x$-Integration.

Evaluating this integral will be postponed until we have done the necessary
formal steps to get to $\Tr(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-2}$, and evaluate the 
$(\lambda,z)$-integral. We will justify this a posteriori.
