\section{Asymptotics of the Boundary Parametrix}
By using the summation formula derived in LV12 the existence and values of the
asymptotic components of the specific operator we're looking at can be
calculated directly. From Formula~\eqref{frm:shift} we know, that we only have to
consider terms up to order $O(\mu^{-3})$ since the requested asymptotic
coefficient is of order $-3$ in the resolvent. We will however employ the same
method to derive the asymptotics up to the next order in the Appendix.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
We will first briefly step through the process that justifies the formula for
the trace-resolvent we are going to use. As introduced in the beginning we
denote the multiplicative part of the operator $\Delta_\lambda$ by $f_\lambda =
\lambda^2 V(x) + W(x)$, i.e.\ $\Delta_\lambda = -\partial_x^2 + f_\lambda(x)$.

The parametrix of $\Delta_\lambda + z^2$ near the boundary (without loss of
generality we will use $x = 0$ as the model case, by the substitution $x\mapsto
1-x$ we get very similar results for $x=1$) can be constructed quite
explicitely. We first consider $L := \Delta_\lambda - f_\lambda(x) =
-\partial_x^2$ acting on $C_0^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, which is essentially
self-adjoint in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we denote the self-adjoint extension by $\bar
L$. Now, for $\theta \in [0,\pi)$, let $L^\theta$ be $\bar L$ restricted to
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{D}(L^\theta) := \left\{ f\in H^1\Rplus \middle| f(0)\cos\theta +
  f'(0)\sin(\theta) = 0\right\},
\end{align}
i.e.\ we employ generalised Neumann boundary conditions. The case $\theta =
\pi$, which is $f'(0) = 0$, is taken out of this although it behaves essentially
the same, we will note where this matters.

% TODO: Das sollte gezeigt oder zumindest begrÃ¼ndet werden! Siehe Note
For $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$, $\Re\mu > 0$ one can show, that the resolvent kernel of
$(\bar L + \mu^2)^{-1}$ is given by
\begin{align}
  k_{(\bar L + \mu^2)^{-1}}(x,y;\mu) = \frac1{2\mu}\Eto{-\mu\Abs{x-y}},
\end{align}
and the kernel of $(L^\theta+\mu^2)^{-1}$ by
\begin{align}
  \label{frm:k-l-theta}
  k_{(L^\theta +\mu^2)^{-1}}(x,y;\mu) = \frac1{2\mu} \left( \Eto{-\mu\Abs{x-y}} +
  C(\mu,\theta)\Eto{-\mu(x+y)}\right), \\
  \label{frm:c-mu-theta}
  \text{with} \quad C(\mu,\theta) :=
  \frac{\mu\sin\theta+\cos\theta}{\mu\sin\theta-\cos\theta}.
\end{align}
However we are interested in the kernel of $(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$ for the
chosen boundary conditions near $x = 0$, namely $(L^\theta + f_\lambda(x) +
z^2)^{-1}$. Let
\begin{align*}
  \mu^2 := \lambda^2 V(0) + z^2
\end{align*}
and note that $\mu^2 = (\mu(0))^2$ using the definition from the previous
section. We will use this abbreviation in this section also as a substitute for
$\Abs{(\lambda,z)}$. Since $V\in C_0^\infty([0,1])$ and $V > 0$ we have $V(0) >
0$ (and $V(1) > 0$), this gives of course the same analytical results, in
particular asymptotics for $\mu\to\infty$ is the same as asymptotics for
$\Abs{(\lambda,z)}\to\infty$.

Now we aim to rewrite the operator-inverse such that we are only inverting
operators that don't depend explicitly on the functions $V$ and $W$, especially
$(L+\mu^2)$ and $(L^\theta+\mu^2)$, for which we have explicit expressions of
their inverse's kernels. We assume for now for some $\delta > 0$ sufficiently
small, that $\supp V \subset [0,\delta]$ and $\Abs{V-V(0)}_{\infty}\leq
\frac12V(0)$. Algebraically we have
\begin{align*}
  (L^\theta + \lambda^2 V(x) + W(x) + z^2)^{-1} =
    \bigl(I + (L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1}(\lambda^2\tilde V(x) + W(x))\bigr)^{-1}
    (L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1}.
\end{align*}
Since for $z$ sufficiently large we have (with $\OpNorm{\cdot}$ being the
operator norm)
\begin{align*}
  \OpNorm{(L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1}(\lambda^2\tilde V(x) + W(x))} \leq
  \frac{\lambda^2\InfNorm{\tilde V} + \InfNorm{W}}{\lambda^2 V(0) + z^2},
  \text{as } \InfNorm{\tilde V} \leq \frac12V(0)
\end{align*}
we can write this as a converging Neumann series:
\begin{align}
  \label{frm:neumann-sum}
  \Rightarrow (L^\theta + \lambda^2 V(x) + W(x) + z^2)^{-1} =
    \sum_{j=0}^\infty (-1)^j \left((L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1}(\lambda^2\tilde V(x)
    + W(x))\right)^j (L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1}.
\end{align}

Now, back to our original $V$ and $W$, we introduce cut-off functions $\phi,
\psi\in\Cinf(\Rplus)$ that are $1$ in a neighbourhood of $x = 0$ and $0$ on
$[\delta,\infty)$. Furthermore $\supp\phi\subset\supp\psi$ and
$\supp\psi\,\cap\,\supp\mathrm d\psi = \emptyset$. Setting $W_\psi(x) :=
\psi(x)W(x)$ and $\tilde V_\psi(x) = \psi(x)V(x) - V(0)$ we have by choosing
$\delta$ small enough $\InfNorm{\tilde V_\psi} < \frac12V(0)$, as needed for the
Neumann series expansion.

Now we set
\begin{align}
  \label{frm:r-delta}
  R_\delta &:= \psi(L^\theta + \lambda^2V_\psi(x) + W_\psi(x) + z^2)^{-1}\phi \\
  \label{frm:f-lambda}
  \text{and } f_\lambda(x) &:= \lambda^2\tilde V_\psi(x) + W_\psi(x).
\end{align}
Note that $f_\lambda(x) = \lambda(V,W)(x)$ in \cite{LV13}, we'll use this
notation to make the distinction between $\lambda$ as a parameter and the
function (which is of order $2$ in $\lambda$) clearer.

It is shown in \cite[Sec. 2]{LV13}, that the previous choices do not change the
asymptotic behaviour of the trace-resolvent at $x=0$ and that for $R_\delta$ the
right-hand-side in \eqref{frm:neumann-sum} is well-defined:
\begin{align*}
  \Tr((L^\theta + \lambda^2 V(x) + W(x) + z^2)^{-1}\phi) =
  \Tr R_\delta + O(\mu^{-\infty}), \quad \text{as } \mu\to\infty.
\end{align*}

We define
\begin{align}
  \label{frm:r-theta}
  R^\theta &:= (L^\theta + \mu^2)^{-1},
\end{align}
for which we already know the kernel by Equation~\eqref{frm:k-l-theta}:
\begin{align*}
  k_{R^\theta}(x,y;\mu) = \frac1{2\mu} \left( \Eto{-\mu\Abs{x-y}} +
  C(\mu,\theta)\Eto{-\mu(x+y)}\right)
\end{align*}
We denote by $R_-$ and $R_+$ the operators belonging to the kernels
\begin{align*}
  k_{R_-}(x,y;\mu) := \tfrac1{2\mu}\Eto{-\mu\Abs{x-y}} \text{ and }
  k_{R_+}(x,y;\mu) := \tfrac1{2\mu}C(\mu,\theta)\Eto{-\mu(x+y)},
\end{align*}
such that $R^\theta = \tfrac1{2\mu}(R_- + R_+)$. Now we can write our Neumann
series as
\begin{align*}
  R_\delta = \sum_{j=0}^\infty (-1)^j M_\psi\left(R^\theta
  M_{f_\lambda}\right)^j R^\theta M_\phi,
\end{align*}
where we have for once explicitly written out $M_f$ to emphasise that we mean
the multiplication operator, whose kernel is defined simply by use of the Dirac
delta-distribution as
\begin{align*}
  k_{M_f}(x,y) = \delta(x-y)f(x).
\end{align*}
Now we insert our newly defined $R_-$ and $R_+$ into the sum and split of the
terms, that only contain $R_-$. To simplify the expressions we define an
abbreviation for the compositions. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\sigma \in
\{+,-\}^n$, i.e.\ a tuple of symbols $+$, $-$, which we will denote when given
explicitly by, e.g.\ $++--+$. Then recursively (starting with
the already defined $R_-$ and $R_+$) define
\begin{align}
  R_\sigma &:= R_{\sigma_1} M_{f_\lambda}
  R_{(\sigma_2,\ldots,\sigma_{n})},
\end{align}
for which we also give the kernels explicitly by use of the formula $k_{AB}(x,y) =
\Integ{\mathbb{R}}{z}{k_A(x,z)k_B(z,y)}$, where we, by slight abuse of notation,
reuse the variable $z$ in the following to denote the integration variable,
which won't lead to ambiguity as the resolvent variable $z$ is hidden in $\mu$
for the whole section. We have
\begin{align}
  k_{R_{(+,\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)}}(x,y) &=
  \frac1{2\mu}C(\mu,\theta)\Int{z}{\Eto{-\mu(x+z)}f_\lambda(z)
  k_{R_\sigma}(z,y)} \\
  k_{R_{(-,\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)}}(x,y) &=
  \frac1{2\mu}\Int{z}{\Eto{-\mu\Abs{x-y}}f_\lambda(z) k_{R_\sigma}(z,y)}.
\end{align}

We can now express, by use of $R_\theta = R_- + R_+$, $R_\delta$ in the
following way:
\begin{align}
  R_\delta = \sum_{j=0}^\infty (-1)^j \psi(x) \sum_{\sigma\in\{+,-\}^{j+1}}
  R_\sigma \phi(x)
\end{align}
The two last results we have to cite are the fact, that terms with $\sigma =
(-,\ldots,-)$ don't contribute to the asymptotics, thus we can rewrite the
formula as
\begin{align}
  R^{(j)} &= (-1)^j \sum_{ \substack{ \sigma\in\{+,-\}^{j+1} \\
  \sigma\neq(-,\ldots,-) } } \psi R_\sigma \phi \\
  \Rightarrow R^0_\delta &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty R^{(j)}.
\end{align}

Finally the following theorem (\cite[Prop 2.2]{LV13}) will be central to the
further considerations:
\begin{Theorem}
  \label{thm:r-expansion}
  Let $M\in\mathbb{N}$, $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}_0$ be fixed. For $\mu_0$
  sufficiently large there exist constants $C>0$, $q\in(0,1)$ such that for
  $N\geq M$ and $\mu \geq \mu_0$
  \begin{align}
    \Norm[\mathrm{tr}]{\partial_\lambda^\alpha\partial^\beta_z R^{(N)}}
    \leq CNq^{N-M}\mu^{-M-\alpha-\beta-3/2}
  \end{align}
  and thus for $\mu\to\infty$
  \begin{align}
    \Norm[\mathrm{tr}]{\partial^\alpha_\lambda\partial^\beta_z\sum_{j=M}^\infty
    R^{(j)}} = O(\mu^{-M-\alpha-\beta-3/2}),
  \end{align}
  where $\|\cdot\|_{\mathrm{tr}}$ denotes the trace norm
  ($\Norm[\mathrm{tr}]{A} = \Tr(A^*A) = \Tr\Abs{A}$).
\end{Theorem}
This tells us, that, since we are aiming to find the asymptotics up to order 2
we need to consider $R^{(j)}$ up to $j=1$, since already the trace of $R^{(2)}$
is $O(\mu^{-7/2})$, i.e.\ $o(\mu^{-3})$.

\subsection{Calculations}
Equipped with the definitions and theorems of the preceding subsection we can
explicitly calculate the asymptotics of the resolvent-trace, which we will do
now for $x=0$. The case $x=1$ is identical to this one if we employ the
transformation $x\mapsto 1-x$, which results in a sign change for odd
derivatives of $f_\lambda(x)$, and of course evaluation at $x=1$ instead of $0$.

From the above considerations we know that we will have to calculate the
asymptotics of $3$ traces.

In the following calculations we define analogous to $R$ the factor
\begin{align}
  C_{(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)} := (-1)^{n+1}\Bigl(\frac{1}{2\mu}\Bigr)^n
  \prod_{ \substack{ 1\le i \le n \\ \sigma_i = - }} C(\mu,\theta).
\end{align}
If $c$ is the count of minuses in $\sigma$, then we can see that
$\lim_{\mu\to\infty} C_\sigma = (-1)^{n+c+1} (2\mu)^{-n}$, since $C(\mu,\theta)
\to -1$. For $\theta = \pi$ we'd get a different result here, namely $C_\sigma
\to (-1)^{n+1}(2\mu)^{-n}$ since $C(\mu,\theta)\to +1$.

The calculation of all terms with $\sigma=(+,\ldots,+)\in\{-,+\}^j$ is
straightforward:
\begin{align*}
  \newtag
  \label{frm:r-plusplus}
  \Tr R_{+\ldots+} &=
    C_{+\ldots+}
    \Int{x}{\left(
      \Integ{[0,1]^{j-1}}{z}{
        \Eto{-\mu((x + z_1) + (z_1 + z_2) + \ldots + (z_{j-1} + x))}
        \prod_{i=1}^{j-1} f_\lambda(z_i)
      }\right)
    } \\
    &= C_{+\ldots+}
      \Int{x}{\Eto{-2\mu x}} \left(\Int{z}{\Eto{-2\mu
      z}f_\lambda(z)}\right)^{j-1} \\
    &= C_{+\ldots+}
      \left(\frac1{2\mu} - \frac{\Eto{-2\mu}}{2\mu}\right)
      \left(\Int{z}{\Eto{-2\mu z}f_\lambda(z)}\right)^{j-1} \\
      &\SimMu (-2\mu)^{-j-1}
      \left(\Wsum{f_\lambda^{(n)}}\right)^{j-1} = (-1)^{j-1} (2\mu)^{-2j}
      \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f_\lambda^{(n)}(0)}{(2\mu)^n}\right)^{j-1}.
\end{align*}
The last transformation uses Watson's lemma as well as the fact, that we can
apply it simultaneously to multiple integrals to determine the common
asymptotics, which is ensured by the finiteness of $F(x) =
\Int{x}{\Eto{-tx}f(t)}$.

From this calculation we immediately get the first term we were looking for:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:tr1}
  \Tr R^{(1)} = \Tr R_+ \SimAs{\mu\to\infty} (2\mu)^{-2}
\end{align}

For higher $j$ terms we need to employ both Watson's Lemma and our integration
formula. The process (which can also be used for higher orders) is always the
same:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write down the whole integral with one large exponential
  \item Combine all terms that appear trivially in the exponent (i.e. not in the
    absolute value of a difference) and split of the $\Int{x}{\Eto{-2\mu
    x}f_\lambda(x)}$-term
  \item For each absolute value of the form $\Abs{x-y}$ in the exponent split
    the corresponding integral in $x > y$ and $x < y$
  \item The resulting parameter in the integral limits can be coped with using
    the integration formula, which flattens the integral
  \item The integral is now in the form of multiple exponential integrals
    multiplied together, so we apply Watson's lemma on each of them
\end{enumerate}
That way we derive a finite product of infinite sums as the asymptotic
expansion. To get an actual coefficient from that we use combinatorics (we could
of course just combine the sum using the Cauchy product formula, but that will
just result in a much more complicated term).

From \eqref{frm:r-plusplus} we know, that 
\begin{align*}
  \Tr R_{++} = -(2\mu)^{-4}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
  \frac{f^{(n)}_\lambda(0)}{(2\mu)^n},
\end{align*}
leading to two contributions. Now we only need to calculate $\Tr R_{+-}$ for
$j=1$, since $\Tr R_{+-} = \Tr R_{-+}$:
\begin{align*}
  \Tr R_{+-} &= C_{+-} \Int{x}{
      \Int{z}{
        \Eto{-\mu(x+z+\Abs{z-x})}
        f_\lambda(z)
      }
    } \\
    &\text{split the integral at $x$} \\
    &= C_{+-} \Int{x}{
      \left(
        \Integ[x]{0}{z}{
          \Eto{-\mu(x+z+x-z)} f_\lambda(z)
        }
      + \Integ[1]{x}{z}{
          \Eto{-\mu(x+z-x+z)} f_\lambda(z)
        }
      \right)
    } \\
    &= C_{+-} \left(\Int{x}{\Integ[x]{0}{z}{\Eto{-2\mu x} f_\lambda(z)}}
    + \Int{x}{\Integ[1]{x}{z}{\Eto{-2\mu z}f_\lambda(z)}} \right) \\
    &= C_{+-} \left(
      \Int{x}{\Eto{-2\mu x} F_\lambda(x)}
      + \Int{x}{\Eto{-2\mu x} xf_\lambda(x)}
      \right) \\
      % Result:
    &\SimAs{\mu\to\infty} %
      (2\mu)^{-2}\left(
      \Wsum{F_\lambda^{(n)}} + \Wsum{nf_\lambda^{(n-1)}}\right)
      = (2\mu)^{-3} \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(n+1)f_\lambda^{(n-1)}(0)}{(2\mu)^n},
\end{align*}
since $F_\lambda(0) = 0$. We also used the identity $(xf(x))^{(n)} = xf^{(n)}(x)
+ nf^{(n-1)}(x)$ (which results in the $nf_\lambda^{(n-1)}(0)$ term as we
evaluate at $0$) as well as the triangle integration
(\thref{lem:triangle-integration}) with $g \equiv 1$.  For the symmetry reasons
given above this is also the asymptotics of $\Tr R_{-+}$, so we have:
\begin{align*}
  \newtag
  \label{eqn:tr2}
  \Tr R^{(2)} &\SimAs{\mu\to\infty} (2\mu)^{-4}
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2(n+2)f_\lambda^{(n)}(0) - f^{(n)}_\lambda(0)}{(2\mu)^n} \\
  &= (2\mu)^{-4} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n + 3)f_\lambda^{(n)}(0)}{(2\mu)^n}
\end{align*}
Now that we have calculated $\Tr R^{(1)}$ and $\Tr R^{(2)}$ we only need to sum
them up and match coefficients to get the first three terms in the asymptotic
expansion of $\Tr(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}$. In particular we have to deal
with the fact, that $f_\lambda(x) = \lambda^2 V_\psi(x) + W_\psi(x)$ is of mixed
order.  Furthermore we note that, as it was for the interior parametrix, the
coefficients of the trace expansion are again a homogeneous polynomial in $V$,
$W$ and their respective derivatives, which will be proven in the next section.
Different from the interior parametrix, the half-integral orders are not 0 by
construction, but the first one indeed is because $\Tr R^{(1)}$ only contributes
to $(\Tr R)_{-2}$ while all other $\Tr R^{(j)}$ also contribute to higher terms.

We get the following three terms of the asymptotic expansion of $\Tr R$:
\begin{align}
  (\Tr R)_{-2} &= \frac{1}{4\mu^2} = \frac{1}{4} (\lambda^2V(0) + z^2)^{-1} \\
  (\Tr R)_{-5/2} &= 0 \\
    (\Tr R)_{-3} &= \frac{5\lambda^2}{(2\mu)^5} V'(0) =
  \frac{5}{32}\frac{\lambda^2 V'(0)}{(\lambda^2 V(0) + z^2)^{-5}}
\end{align}

We have thus proven the following theorem
\begin{MainTheorem}
  \label{main:boundary}
  \input{snippets/main-exterior}
  \begin{Corollary}
    \label{cor:boundary}
    Using the previous definitions we also get the expansion near $1$ by
    considering a new cutoff function $\psi$ on $(0,1]$ that is $0$ outside of a
    sufficiently small neighbourhood of $x=1$.
    \begin{align*}
      \Tr(\psi(x)(\Delta_\lambda + z^2)^{-1}) \SimMu
      \frac{1}{(2\mu)^2} - \frac{5\lambda^2}{(2\mu)^5} V'(1) + O(\mu^{-4})
    \end{align*}
    \begin{Proof}
      Apply \thref{main:boundary} to the operator
      \begin{align*}
        \tilde\Delta_\lambda = \Delta_\lambda\circ(x\mapsto 1-x).
      \end{align*}
      That way all analytical properties are kept, but $\partial_x^n|_{x=0}
      \mapsto (-1)^n \partial_x^n|_{x=1}$, so a sign is introduced for odd
      derivatives and we evaluate at $x=1$.
    \end{Proof}
  \end{Corollary}
\end{MainTheorem}
