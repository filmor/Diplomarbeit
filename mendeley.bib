@article{Bar2008a,
abstract = {Let \$H\_h = h\^{}2 L +V\$ where \$L\$ is a self-adjoint Laplace type operator acting on sections of a vector bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold and \$V\$ is a symmetric endomorphism field. We derive an asymptotic expansion for the heat kernel of \$H\_h\$ as \$h \backslash to 0\$. As a consequence we get an asymptotic expansion for the quantum partition function and we see that it is asymptotic to the classical partition function. Moreover, we show how to bound the quantum partition function for positive \$h\$ by the classical partition function.},

@article{Booss-Bavnbek2007,
abstract = {Quantum gravity was born as that branch of modern theoretical physics that tries to unify its guiding principles, i.e., quantum mechanics and general relativity. Nowadays it is providing new insight into the unification of all fundamental interactions, while giving rise to new developments in modern mathematics. It is however unclear whether it will ever become a falsifiable physical theory, since it deals with Planck-scale physics. Reviewing a wide range of spectral geometry from index theory to spectral triples, we hope to dismiss the general opinion that the mere mathematical complexity of the unification programme will obstruct that programme.},

@article{Lesch2009c,
abstract = {We express the Connes-Chern character of the Dirac operator associated to a b-metric on a manifold with boundary in terms of a retracted cocycle in relative cyclic cohomology, whose expression depends on a scaling/cut-off pa- rameter. Blowing-up the metric one recovers the pair of characteristic currents that represent the corresponding de Rham relative homology class, while the blow-down yields a relative cocycle whose expression involves higher eta cochains and their b-analogues. The corresponding pairing formulae with relative K-theory classes capture information about the boundary and allow to derive geometric consequences. As a by-product, we show that the generalized Atiyah-Patodi-Singer pairing introduced by Getzler and Wu is necessarily restricted to almost flat bundles.},

@book{Miller2006,
abstract = {This book is a survey of asymptotic methods set in the current applied research context of wave propagation. It stresses rigorous analysis in addition to formal manipulations. Asymptotic expansions developed in the text are justified rigorously, and students are shown how to obtain solid error estimates for asymptotic formulae. The book relates examples and exercises to subjects of current research interest, such as the problem of locating the zeros of Taylor polynomials of entirenonvanishing functions and the problem of counting integer lattice points in subsets of the plane with various geometrical properties of the boundary. The book is intended for a beginning graduate course on asymptotic analysis in applied mathematics and is aimed at students of pure and appliedmathematics as well as science and engineering. The basic prerequisite is a background in differential equations, linear algebra, advanced calculus, and complex variables at the level of introductory undergraduate courses on these subjects. The book is ideally suited to the needs of a graduate student who, on the one hand, wants to learn basic applied mathematics, and on the other, wants to understand what is needed to make the various arguments rigorous. Down here in the Village, this is knownas the Courant point of view!! --Percy Deift, Courant Institute, New York Peter D. Miller is an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona and has held positions at the Australian NationalUniversity (Canberra) and Monash University (Melbourne). His current research interests lie in singular limits for integrable systems.},
