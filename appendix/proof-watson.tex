\begin{theorem}
    \input{snippets/watsons-lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The proof due to Miller (ref MILLER) uses the Taylor series expansion of
        $g(t)$ with a remainder term in the integrand.

        Since we only assume differentiability in some neighbourhood of $t=0$ we
        need to estimate the integral for some $0 < s < T$, with $s$ being
        sufficiently small such that $g\in C^{\infty}([0,s])$. We can now split
        up the integral $F(x)$ as
        \begin{align*}
            F(x) = \Integ[s]{0}{t}{\Eto{-xt}\phi(t)} +
                   \Integ[T]{s}{t}{\Eto{-xt}\phi(t)}.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{remark}
        There is also a very simple proof using the so called Moment Expansion
        by Estrada (ref).
    \end{remark}
