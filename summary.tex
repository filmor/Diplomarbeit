\section{Summary}
We have given methods and formulas to calculate the resolvent-trace asymptotics
for Sturm-Lioville operators on a closed interval, where our results for the
interior are in line with the prior work in \cite[Gel'fand1975]. The methods for
the evaluation of the boundary asymptotics could be expanded, especially the
proof of the homogeneity can potentially be used for an algorithmical approach
on the problem.
