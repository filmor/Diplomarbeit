\section{Summary}
We have given methods and formulas to calculate the resolvent trace asymptotics
for Sturm-Lioville operators on a closed interval, where our results for the
interior are in line with the prior work in \cite{Gel'fand1975}. The methods for
the evaluation of the boundary asymptotics can be expanded, especially the proof
of the homogeneity can be used for an algorithmical approach to the problem of
finding higher orders of the resolvent trace. The requirement ``$V$ and $W$
analytic'' can also be relaxed at least for the calculation of the formula by
careful estimation of the higher derivatives.
